                I recently worked 6 months as a <b>digital experience & marketing intern</b> at <a href="resume.html#rtm" class="internalLink">Reading Terminal Market</a>, one of America's largest and oldest public markets. I kept the website updated daily with new events and notifications, created a new interactive visualization of the market map to improve navigation, and created many designs for event promotion. I learned a lot about diverse fields in a never-stopping public space, at a time of preparation for a 5 year strategic plan publication.

                Previously, I worked as a <b>front-end website developer intern</b> for 6 months at <a href="resume.html#framewrk" class="internalLink">Framewrk agency</a>, a startup whose goal is to help entrepreneurs grow their business. I had the opportunity to learn how a project develops in a professional background and to help create new features on the website. The project I am most proud of is making a discussion forums chat card, that enabled entrepreneurs to gain information about different topics. As part of this, I had to dive into the backend to store and retrieve data. During that time, I also became extremely attracted to UX design and decided to pursue a minor in it.

                I am always working towards learning and gaining more experience in this field, and towards building this creative portfolio to output my efforts and achievements. I have always been hugely interested in art and love to paint and draw, so I multiple art class electives. Consequently, I added a minor in Fine Arts to my studies, and I am now excited to keep on constructing my portfolio with a mix of both artistic capabilities and technological skill.
