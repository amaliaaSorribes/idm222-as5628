                She recently worked 6-month as a <b>digital marketing intern</b> at <a href="resume.html#rtm" class="internalLink">Reading Terminal Market</a>, one of America's largest and oldest public markets. She kept the website updated daily with new events and notifications, created a new interactive visualization of the market map to improve navigation, and created many designs for event promotion. Amalia learned a lot along diverse fields from a never-stopping public space at a time of preparation for a 5 year strategic plan publication.

                Previously, she worked as a <b>front-end website developer</b> as a 6-month intern at <a href="resume.html#framewrk" class="internalLink">Framewrk agency</a>, a startup whose goal is to help entrepreneurs grow their business. She had the opportunity to learn how a project develops in a professional background and helped create new features to be directly reflected on the website. The task she is most proud about is the making of a discussion forums chat card, that enabled entrepreneurs gain information from different topics, as she had to acquire backend awareness to store and retrieve data for it to be functional. During that time, she also became extremely attracted to the UX minor and decided to add it to her field of study to continue exploring it.

                Amalia is now working towards her goal of keep adding more experience on this field and build this creative portfolio to output her efforts and achievements. She has always been hugely interested in art and loves to paint and draw so she started filling up her free electives at uni with art classes. Consequently added a minor in Fine Arts and is now excited to keep on constructing her life with a mix of both her artistic capabilities and technological knowledge.
