# Ideas

- Keep domain https://amaliasorribes.com/ old portfolio (up until October 3rd)

- Portfolio page should look kind of like a physical portfolio in where you can select folders (CS, UX and art) that will take you to the sub-pages

- Art page either has a horizontal gallery with all images and then sub-galleries for each medium used or has a unique gallery to be filtered by medium, color, concept, year…

- Projects from CS and UX should be distinguishable, if not unify them somehow

- The underlined text in the About page should be of different coloured font for higher contrast

- Keep slogan: Where creativity meets functionality

## About

Amalia Sorribes is a senior at Drexel University with an **expected graduation** date of **September 2025**. She is on track to complete a Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science**, complemented by two minors: **User Experience and Interaction Design**, and **Fine Arts**. 

Philadelphia has provided Amalia, an international student from Spain, with valuable opportunities to enhance her professional skills. 

During the span of the last 3 years, while taking classes, she has worked as a **Teacher Assistant** at *Drexel* for the College of Computing and Informatics. In total, she has been employed to help students with 4 different courses: CI103- Computing and Informatics Design III, CS164- Introduction to Computer Science, CS171- Computer Programming I, and CS281- Systems Architecture. Having previously worked as a teacher and teacher assistant for the technological summer camp of *ICAI University*, she possesses great human interaction skills.

She recently worked 6-month as a digital marketing intern at *Reading Terminal Market*, one of America’s largest and oldest public markets. She kept the website updated daily with new events and notifications, created a new interactive visualization of the market map to improve navigation, and created many designs for event promotion. Amalia learned a lot along diverse fields from a never-stopping public space at a time of preparation for a 5 year strategic plan publication.

Previously, she worked as a front-end website developer as a 6-month intern at *Framewrk agency*, a startup whose goal is to help entrepreneurs grow their business. She had the opportunity to learn how a project develops in a professional background and helped create new features to be directly reflected on the website. The task she is most proud about is the making of a discussion forums chat card, that enabled entrepreneurs gain information from different topics, as she had to acquire backend awareness to store and retrieve data for it to be functional. During that time, she also became extremely attracted to the UX minor and decided to add it to her field of study to continue exploring it.

Amalia is now working towards her goal of keep adding more experience on this field and build this creative portfolio to output her efforts and achievements. She has always been hugely interested in art and loves to paint and draw so she started filling up her free electives at uni with art classes. Consequently added a minor in Fine Arts and is now excited to keep on constructing her life with a mix of both her artistic capabilities and technological knowledge.

*My Personal Journey: CS to UX*
I’ve always been passionate about computers and technology. As a kid, I enjoyed programming video games and trying to figure out how they worked. When I went to college, I decided to pursue a degree in computer science.

I love my computer science classes, but I found that I was more interested in the human side of technology. I wanted to create products that were not only technically impressive but also easy to use and enjoyable for people.

For my first co-op experience, I worked as a front-end software developer. I worked on a variety of projects, but I felt like I wanted to experience the design process underneath. I wanted to have a more direct impact on the user experience of the products I was working on.

Therefore, I added a minor in user experience and interaction design to learn more about the field. I’m currently mastering new skills in user research, interaction design, and visual design. I’m passionate about this new opportunity and willing to put in the work to succeed.

I’m grateful for my background in both computer science and UX design. It’s the perfect combination for achieving my goal of using my technical skills to create products that make a real difference in people’s lives.

# Extras

*As I already had a portfolio website, here are some texts I could use but I don’t know where to place them or if they are relevant anymore. They were mainly posts.*

#### The Sea: A Muse for the Mind
The sea has been a source of inspiration for artists and creatives for centuries. Its vastness and beauty, its ever-changing nature, and its mysterious depths have captured the imagination of people from all walks of life.

For painters, the sea offers a never-ending variety of subjects and moods. The crashing waves, the sparkling surface, and the deep blue depths can all be captured in a painting, and each artist brings their own unique perspective to the canvas.

For writers, the sea can provide a setting for adventure, romance, or mystery. It can also be a symbol of the human condition, representing our deepest fears and desires.

For musicians, the sea can be a source of inspiration for melodies, rhythms, and harmonies. The sound of the waves crashing against the shore, the wind whistling through the sails, and the creaking of a ship’s hull can all be incorporated into a piece of music.

But even if you’re not a traditional artist, the sea can still be a source of inspiration for your creative work. Whether you’re a designer, a photographer, a filmmaker, or a poet, the sea can help you to see the world in new and interesting ways.

#### The Art of the Everyday
We live in a world that is full of art. It surrounds us in everything from the buildings we see to the clothes we wear to the food we eat. But what is art, really?

Art is often defined as the expression of creativity and imagination. It can be expressed in many different forms, including visual art, music, literature, and dance. But art can also be found in the everyday things that we do.

For example, cooking a meal can be considered an art form. When we cook, we use our creativity to combine different ingredients and flavors to create a delicious and visually appealing dish.

Another example of everyday art is gardening. When we garden, we use our creativity to design and plant our gardens in a way that is both beautiful and functional.

Even the way we dress can be considered an art form. When we choose our clothes, we are expressing our personal style and creativity.

The truth is, art is all around us. It is in the things that we do, the things that we see, and the things that we create. We just have to be open to seeing it.

Here is a challenge for you: today, try to find the art in the everyday. It could be something as simple as a beautiful flower or a well-designed building. Or, it could be something more complex, like a delicious meal or a piece of music that moves you.

Once you have found a piece of everyday art, take a moment to appreciate it. Notice the details and the way that it makes you feel. And remember, **art is all around us, if we only take the time to see it.**
